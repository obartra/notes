# Optimizing Images for the web

As much progress as the web has had in recent years, there hasn't been a new cross-browser image format that takes advantage of modern compression algorithms.

## Formats

To bridge this gap, different vendors have developed different solutions. On the purest 90's browser war style, no vendor has implemented any solution other than their own.

- Google developed the [WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) format, which is available for Chrome and Opera
- Microsoft created [JPEG XR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XR) (JXR), as an improvement over JPEG. It is available on IE9+ and MS Edge
- Mozilla has invested in [mozjpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libjpeg), a fork of libjpeg-turbo that achieves ~10% better compression

Thus, we are forced to conditionally serve images on different formats if we want to deliver the most optimized possible option.

When we create these files, since `WebP` and `JPEG XR` accept different quality settings, we need to know if the image looks good. We want to compress the image as much as we can without loosing quality. There are several ways to do that, but, to choose one, we'll use SSIM.

## SSIM

[SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) is a value from 0 to 100% that rates how similar two images will be perceived by a human viewer. SSIM results correlate with other approaches like [PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) but has higher sensitivity to JPEG compression artifacts ([A. HorÃ© and D. Ziou, 2010](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Image-Quality-Metrics-PSNR-vs-SSIM-Hor%C3%A9-Ziou/cfab5b500506078117125146c0d283d2392ff2e3/pdf)).

At around 95% SSIM differences are not discernible by most people ([JR. Flynn et al., 2013](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Image-Quality-Assessment-Using-the-SSIM-and-the-Flynn-Ward/056e28a107a2ff32114a24b7ec33dc6b18752766/pdf)). The exact number depends on the person, the image, distance from the screen and lighting (among other factors). For that reason, 95% is not an absolute number, but it should be a good enough approximation for most purposes.

To asses SSIM values we'll use a [script](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/ssim/index.php) that relies on [image magick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php). I've included a copy of the file under `scripts/ssim.sh`.

## Goals (TL;DR)

We want to:

- Serve `.webp` images on Chrome an Opera
- Serve `.jxr` on IE9+ and MS Edge
- Serve optimized `.png` and `.jpg` otherwise
- Maintain a SSIM >= 95%
- Automate image format generation
- Automate image serving

## Install

Let's set up our environment so that we can generate and optimize these images.


```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libgif-dev webp libjxr-tools autoconf automake libtool nasm make pngquant imagemagick

wget https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg/releases/download/v3.1/mozjpeg-3.1-release-source.tar.gz
tar -xvf mozjpeg-3.1-release-source.tar.gz
cd mozjpeg
autoreconf -fiv
mkdir build && cd build
sh ../configure
sudo make install

# Make /opt/mozjpeg/bin/jpegtran available as mozjpeg
sudo ln -s /opt/mozjpeg/bin/jpegtran /usr/local/bin/mozjpeg
```

**TIP**: If you want to reproduce these steps as you read, you can clone [this repo](https://github.com/obartra/notes) and `cd` to the `imageOptimization` folder.

## WebP

WebP supports transparency and animations so it's a good option for compressing `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg` and `gif` files.

Let's say we receive `assets/input.jpg` to optimize. It's a JPEG image saved at already a decently small file size (63.2kb).

![Formats Comparison](assets/input.jpg)

The webp compressor (`cwebp`) takes an input file, a quality parameter and an output file:

```bash
cwebp assets/input.jpg -q 80 -o assets/output-q80.webp
```

That generates a 31.2kb image (about ~2x smaller). These are impressive savings! But how do we know if it's noticeably different from the input?

We want to be able to generate these images programatically so we don't want to manually verify each one of them. Here is where SSIM comes in:

```bash
./scripts/ssim.sh assets/input.jpg assets/output-q80.webp
# ssim=0.945 dssim=0.055
```

If we want a higher compression we can just change the quality parameter. For instance `-q 65` leads to a SSIM of 93% and a file size of 24.1kb

| Quality | WebP 80 | WebP 65 | WebP 10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image |![Q80](assets/output-q80.webp) | ![Q65](assets/output-q65.webp) | ![Q10](assets/output-q10.webp) |
| Size | 31.2kb | 24.1kb | 9.6kb |
| SSIM | 94.5% | 93% | 88% |

## JXR

The process for JXR is similar to that of WebP but the input formats are restricted to `bmp`, `tif` and `hdr` ðŸ˜¨

We already have `imagemagick` installed so we can leverage it to generate the file. Since `bmp` is lossless there shouldn't be a concern for degradation. Let's try it:

```bash
convert assets/input.jpg assets/intermediate.bmp
JxrEncApp -i assets/intermediate.bmp -o assets/output-q65.jxr -q 0.65
rm assets/intermediate.bmp
```

Similarly, we can also play with the quality setting to modify the SSIM and file size.

| Quality | JXR 80 | JXR 65 | JXR 10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image |![Q80](assets/output-q80.jxr) | ![Q65](assets/output-q65.jxr) | ![Q10](assets/output-q10.jxr) |
| Size | 87.0kb | 66.8kb | 17.0kb |
| SSIM | 96% | 95% | 90% |

## JPEG and PNG

Ok, so what happens when someone visits our site and they are not using IE, Edge, Chrome or Opera? Maybe they are on Firefox or Safari or some other browser. We need to optimize for these cases as well.

For that same `assets/input.jpg` we would do:

```bash
mozjpeg -optimize assets/input.jpg > assets/output.jpg
```

In this case our input image was already an optimized `jpeg` and `mozjpeg` wasn't able to obtain any additional gains. That happens some times. On occasion a `jxr` or a `webp` file will even be larger than the input `jpeg`.

These should be edge cases but we need to account for those so that we don't end up serving larger files.

Finally, if the input image was a `png` we would optimize it like:

```
pngquant --speed=1 assets/input.png -o assets/output.png
```

That output has a SSIM of 94% and a file size of 64.8kb (x3 smaller than the input `png`).

| Quality | Unoptimized PNG | Optimized PNG |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image |![no-optim](assets/input.png) | ![optim](assets/output.png) |
| Size | 206.1kb | 64.8kb |
| SSIM | N/A | 94% |

## Serving Images

We've started with a single `assets/input.jpg`. At this point we should have an optimized version of the `jpg` file, a `webp` one and `jxr` one. How do we deliver them to the right user?

There are several potential approaches:

### Front End Solutions

If we need to support an image-heavy application that would benefit from `webp` optimizations, it may be worth [polyfilling browser WebP support](https://webpjs.appspot.com/) and only serve that format.

We could also use a library like [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) to detect [WebP support](https://modernizr.com/download?setclasses&q=webp). Our code would then look something like this:

```javascript
const img = document.querySelector('.myImg');
Modernizr.on('webp', supportsWebP => {
	if (supportsWebP) {
		img.src = img.src.replace(/.jpe?g$/, '.webp');
	}
});
```

This approach gets messy quickly. So a simpler alternative may be to solve this problem on the server side.

### Back End Solutions

When we send a `GET` or a `HEAD` request for a URL we are already sending information on the supported file types for our current browser. This allows us to seamlessly re-write paths.

If you are using [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) or [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/) you may want to check out [webp-jxr-middleware](https://github.com/obartra/webp-jxr-middleware) that does just that.

A simplified version of `webp-jxr-middleware` could look like:

```javascript
import { join } from 'path';
import express from 'express';
import { parse } from 'url';

const app = express();

function replacePath() {
	return function (request, response, next) {
		if (request.headers.accept.includes('image/webp')) {
			request.url = request.url.replace(/.(jpe?g|png)$/, '.webp');
			response.set('Content-Type', 'image/webp');
		} else if (request.headers.accept.includes('image/jxr')) {
			request.url = request.url.replace(/.jpe?g$/, '.jxr');
			response.set('Content-Type', 'image/jxr');
		}
		next();
	}
}

app.listen(8888);
app.use(replacePath());
app.use(express.static(path));
```

## Automation

The Back End approach solves automating serving the right images but, how do we automate generation?

Combining the previous scripts, we could do something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename=$(basename $1)
extension="${filename##*.}"
filename="${filename%.*}"

# Generate WebP format
for ext in jpeg jpg gif png; do
	if [[ $extension == $ext ]]; then
		cwebp $1 -q 80 -o "$filename.webp"
	fi
done

# Optimize PNG
if [[ $extension  == "png" ]]; then
	pngquant --speed=1 --force $1 -o $1
fi

# Generate JXR and optimize JPG
for ext in jpeg jpg; do
	if [[ $extension  == $ext ]]; then
		convert $1 "$filename.bmp"
		JxrEncApp -i "$filename.bmp" -o "$filename.jxr" -q 0.65
		rm "$filename.bmp"
		mozjpeg -optimize $1 > "$filename.tmp"
		mv "$filename.tmp" $1
	fi
done

```

This script may be a starting point but we need to recursively optimize images until they achieve the target SSIM. We also want to check the file size to make sure the generated images are smaller than the input.
